      <li>Description <p> OBH has a reality game show called the Dating Game where the host, SmartPants, instructs a group of novices on the finer points of socializing. On one particular episode, SmartPants brings the group into a club. The goal of each Contestant is to get phone numbers from potential Dates at the club. He has num_rounds to do so. Three types of threads: SmartPants Contestant Date Each Contestant arrives at the club on his own (simulated by sleep(random time)). When the Contestant arrives, he has to meet SmartPants. Contestant will do busy waiting until SmartPants lets him know that he is available to meet. SmartPants will talk to each Contestant in FCFS order (you can use a Boolean array/vector, queue like structure in order to enforce the order). After the initiation, Contestants enter the club to meet a Date. If there is no Date available, the Contestant will kill some time at the Juice Bar (use yield( ) and after sleep(random time)). </p>
